## memoryMachine aka All of Your Sounds (AoYS)

A system design for taking a very large library of sounds and creating an endlessly changing "soundscape" (for lack of a better phrase?). 

I use it with a library of 1100 sounds representing the audio tracks of every video in my cloud library. 

Currently designed to run either on a desktop computer or a Bela. I've been testing it mainly on a Bela Gem board. 

To use: 
- download all the patches in this repo
- make a folder in the same directory called "sounds" or something
- put a lot of sound files in there. I'd recommend doing over 1000!
- open "_main.pd" in Pure Data
- the sounds should automatically be mixed and edited together endlessly

These patches run well on a Bela, more details about that soon
